# MC-D CLONE
🍔 Here's my McDonald's UI clone, featuring an intuitive design and smooth user experience.
🔍 Implemented search functionality, allowing users to easily find their favorite menu items with ease.
🎯 The add-to-cart feature ensures a seamless shopping experience, just like the real deal.
✨ The project includes smooth scrolling for a polished, interactive feel across the page.
💻 Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project helped me enhance my front-end development skills and attention to detail.
